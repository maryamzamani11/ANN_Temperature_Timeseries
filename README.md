# Forecasting Temperature Timeseries
In this repository, I forecast temperature time series of New York city using both traditional time series analysis techniques (ARIMA) and deep learning. I applied different deep learning techniques to this dataset including ANN, RNN (LSTM) and CNN. The data is downloaded from Kaggle [daily_temperature_of_major_cities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/daily-temperature-of-major-cities). My analysis shows CNN shows the best forecast result for this dataset!
